    <h1>Max Temperature</h1>

    <p>As we move further from Latitude 0, we see a decrease in max temperatures both North and South of the equator. This relationship is more clear when we filter the data by Northern and Souther Hemisphere. Leaving us with the ability to run a linear regression and seeing a positive relationship in the Southern Hemisphere between Latitude vs Max Temp & a negative relationship in the Northern Hemisphere between Latitude vs Max Temperature. </p>
