    <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to visualize the weather of over 500 cities across the world to see how weather changes as we get closer to the equator. We utilized a simple Python library, the Open Weather Map API and some creativity to visualize the weather across the world. </p>
    <br>
    <p>To create these series of scatter plots we observed a few different factors including:</p>
        <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
        <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
    <p>This site provides the data we used to observe the weather. All the visualizations created from the dataset include a description and explanation of the trends and correlations found.</p>
